# AirQualityTest
My First ML(Regression) project which summarises all my recent learnings regarding Regression...

## Dataset Description:
This dataset typically contains environmental measurements and related factors over time.
It is often used for regression, classification, or time-series analysis in machine learning. 

Here's a concise description:

# Features:

Environmental variables (e.g., PM2.5, PM10, CO, NO2, SO2, O3).

Meteorological factors (e.g., temperature, humidity, wind speed, pressure).

Spatial and temporal data (e.g., location coordinates, timestamps).

# Target:

Air Quality Index (AQI) or pollutant concentrations (e.g., PM2.5 levels).

### Insights:

Used several different models but the best one was Polynomial Regression model..

Mean absolute error of Polynomial regression model is:  0.1321937386189513

R2 score  of Polynomial regression model is:  0.7973665781296121
